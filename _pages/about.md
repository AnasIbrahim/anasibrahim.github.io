I am a PhD researcher at TU Dortmund University, nearing completion of my PhD in computer vision for robotics. My work focuses on deep learning methods for unseen objects, with a background in robotics hardware and software, including electronics, embedded systems, localization, and perception. My main research interests are generalized vision deep learning and high-speed perception with event cameras.
